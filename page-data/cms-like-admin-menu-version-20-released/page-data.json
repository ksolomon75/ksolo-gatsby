No functional changes have been made (or needed), but the plugin in now 100% compatible with WordPress 2.7.  You can get the updated version either via the automatic update function, or you can head over to the <a href=\"http://keithsolomon.net/cms-menu/\">plugin page</a> to grab a copy manually.</p>\n<p>You may also notice that there are now two download options on the plugin page.  This is because version 2.0 is <strong>only</strong> for WordPress versions 2.7 and above.  The menu item numbers changed in 2.7, so the new version of the plugin won&#8217;t work correctly on WordPress 2.6 or earlier.  If you&#8217;re still running version 1.0 of the plugin on an older version of WordPress, there&#8217;s no need to update, as you already have the newest version that will work for you (though, I highly recommend you upgrade WordPress as soon as possible to take advantage of the new features and security enhancements).</p>\n<p>As always, please feel free to leave any comments on the plugin page.</p>\n","title":"CMS-Like Admin Menu – Version 2.0 Released.","date":"February 10, 2009","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/ctc-upgrade-coming-soon/","title":"CTC — Upgrade Coming Soon"},"next":{"uri":"/question-for-the-wp-theme-devs-in-the-audience/","title":"Question for the WP theme devs in the audience"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDc=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjE=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
