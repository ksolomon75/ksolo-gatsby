Over the weekend, Windows XP decided it didn&#8217;t want to run on my file server any longer (yeah, I know&#8230; ðŸ™‚ ).  In it&#8217;s place I installed <a href=\"http://ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> 8.04 &#8220;Hardy Heron&#8221;.  After migrating my SwissCenter settings over to the new Linux install, everything worked, except SwissCenter no longer showed up on the Sources page on the A-100.</p>\n<p>After a few hours of searching and a post to the SwissCenter forums, I got a reply from the SwissCenter team pointing me at the broadcast.pl script that comes with SwissCenter.  Out of the box, things were promising, as I could see the A-100 talking to the broadcast script, but still no link on the sources screen.  After another few hours of testing (and a good nights&#8217; sleep), I found the problem.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the script and my fix, and download my broadcast script package over at the <a href=\"/swisscenter-broadcast-script/\">SwissCenter UPnP/SSDP Broadcast Script for PopcornHour A-100</a> page.  If you have any questions, please leave a comment either on this post, or on the download page.</p>\n","title":"Linux, SwissCenter, and the PopcornHour A-100","date":"September 11, 2008","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/wordpress-plugins-upgrade-tip/","title":"WordPress Plugins Upgrade Tip"},"next":{"uri":"/funny-firefox-session/","title":"Funny Firefox Session"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODc=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxOTk=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxNDI="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
