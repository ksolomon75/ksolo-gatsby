I figured I&#8217;d get a few downloads here and there, but as of this afternoon, it&#8217;s been downloaded 97,586 times&#8230;that&#8217;s amazing!  It also makes what I&#8217;m about to say even harder.</p>\n<p>As of today, Feb. 7, 2013, development is officially over (for me, anyway&#8230;more on that in a bit).  The plugin was made to scratch an itch I had way back when WP first released the tag cloud feature.  I&#8217;m honored that so many of you have downloaded and used this plugin on your sites.  That said, with work and life being what they are, I just don&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to it any more.  The plugin does what I set out to accomplish.  Are there things I would like to see it do?  Yes&#8230;people have asked for an exclude option for years, and I never got around to figuring out how to accomplish that&#8230;but by and large, it does what it&#8217;s supposed to, and IMO it does it well.  But don&#8217;t worry, the plugin isn&#8217;t going away.  I will leave it&#8217;s page here up as long as my site is active, and it will remain in the WP Extend repo, so it will always be available.</p>\n<p>So, where do we go from here?  Well, I would love to see someone pick up from where I&#8217;m leaving off.  Someone who has the time to devote to make it better than it is.  Do you think you&#8217;re the one for the job?  Drop me a line and let&#8217;s talk&#8230;</p>\n","title":"The future of the CTC plugin","date":"February 07, 2013","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/death-plays-a-game/","title":"Short story: “Death Plays A Game”"},"next":{"uri":"/mini-book-review-wordpress-plugin-development-cookbook/","title":"Mini Book Review: “WordPress Plugin Development Cookbook”"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0NjA=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0NzE=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo0MDU="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
