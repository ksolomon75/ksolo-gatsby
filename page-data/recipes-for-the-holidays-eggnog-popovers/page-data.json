When smooth, whisk in flour and salt.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Remove heated muffin tin from oven and quickly divide the batter into the muffin cups.  Bake for 20 minutes at 450F, then use a sharp knife to poke a small hole in the top of each popover to release steam and prevent them from deflating and reduce oven heat to 375F.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Bake for an additional 15 minutes, until golden brown and crisp.&nbsp; Makes 6 popovers.</p>\n<div class=\"wlWriterSmartContent\" id=\"0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:86d918ae-aca2-4081-a764-dc7c3f1fe875\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;\">Technorati tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/cooking\" rel=\"tag\">cooking</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/recipe\" rel=\"tag\">recipe</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/recipes\" rel=\"tag\">recipes</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/holiday\" rel=\"tag\">holiday</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/holidays\" rel=\"tag\">holidays</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/muffins\" rel=\"tag\">muffins</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/eggnog\" rel=\"tag\">eggnog</a></div>\n<p></p>\n","title":"Recipes for the Holidays: Eggnog Popovers","date":"December 24, 2006","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/last-sunset-of-2006/","title":"Last sunset of 2006"},"next":{"uri":"/live-writer/","title":"Live Writer"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNA==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxNQ==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
