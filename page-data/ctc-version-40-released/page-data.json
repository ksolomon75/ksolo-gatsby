What makes it new, you ask?  Well, how about the ability to include your WordPress categories in your tag cloud?  It&#8217;s a feature that people have been (erroneously) assuming CTC supports for a while, but I never could get it to work&#8230;well, now I have.  It&#8217;s as simple as adding another parameter to your template tag, or clicking a radio button in the widget admin.  Give it a try, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll like it!</p>\n<p>Also new in this release is some tweaks to the color functions.  Prior to this version, if you wanted your tag cloud links to use the same color as the rest of the links in your site or sidebar, you had to manually enter the color definition in both the min and max color fields or parameters.  No more.  Now, if you leave both colors blank, your tags will be the same color as the rest of your links.  If you only use one of the two fields, your tag links will all be that color.</p>\n<p>As always, you can find more info and the download (and leave your comments) on the <a href=\"http://keithsolomon.net/ctc\">CTC</a> page.</p>\n","title":"CTC – Version 4.0 Released","date":"February 15, 2008","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/ctc-version-41-released/","title":"CTC – Version 4.1 Released"},"next":{"uri":"/off-site-backups-and-amazon-s3/","title":"Off-site Backups and Amazon S3"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDU=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDozNg==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMDQ="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
