I have finally gotten around to (and had the time to spare in between freelance gigs) implementing a few changes that I have had on my list for a while.</p>\n<p>My favorite change is the addition of Live Search for the site.  If you look in the sidebar, you&#8217;ll notice that the search box now says &#8220;type and wait for results&#8221;.  Well, that&#8217;s all you have to do to search my site now.  when you enter a search term, it will overlay (or push down the other content if you&#8217;re using Internet Explorer) a box with the search results in it.  You can either use the arrow keys and enter to choose one of the results or use the mouse.  You can also go to the regular search results page if you so desire.</p>\n<p>The next biggest change is I have added AJAX commenting to posts.  Now when you enter a comment, it adds it to the page automatically, without refreshing the page.  It will also show icons for your country, your operating system, and your browser.  You will also notice that on the individual post pages, there is now a block with the info about the post you&#8217;re currently reading and navigation links for the next and previous articles in the sidebar.</p>\n<p>So yeah.  I got a few things crossed off the list.  There will be a few more changes coming, but I don&#8217;t know right now when they&#8217;ll be.  Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><!-- Technorati Tags Start --></p>\n<p>Technorati Tags:<br />\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Design\" rel=\"tag\">Design</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Updates\" rel=\"tag\">Updates</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/AJAX\" rel=\"tag\">AJAX</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Live%20Search\" rel=\"tag\">Live Search</a>\n</p>\n<p><!-- Technorati Tags End --></p>\n","title":"Site Updates","date":"February 22, 2007","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/feed-craziness/","title":"Feed Craziness"},"next":{"uri":"/flash-for-websites/","title":"Flash for websites?"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxOQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyMA==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxNw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
