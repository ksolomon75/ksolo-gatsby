The effect of this is the widget portion of my configurable tag could plugin doesn&#8217;t work the way it should any more. I have started working on upgrading the plugin to work with the new API, and it&#8217;s looking good so far. There will also be a couple of new features in the new version. I&#8217;m not quite ready to talk about those features, but I think they will be welcome additions.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><s>That said, version 5.0 of the plugin will be released for WordPress version 2.8+ </s><strong><s>ONLY</s></strong><s>, so if you want the new features, you will have to upgrade your WordPress install.</s> I figured out I could make it work for all versions of WP 2.3 and beyond. I have a couple of folks beta testing the new version, and when they give me the all-clear, I&#8217;ll release it so keep an eye out here or your WordPress plugins page for the notice.</p>\n<p><br class=\"final-break\" style=\"clear: both\" /></p>\n","title":"CTC — Upgrade Coming Soon","date":"June 28, 2009","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/ctc-version-5-0-released/","title":"CTC – Version 5.0 Released!"},"next":{"uri":"/cms-like-admin-menu-version-20-released/","title":"CMS-Like Admin Menu – Version 2.0 Released."}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjE=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjQ=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
