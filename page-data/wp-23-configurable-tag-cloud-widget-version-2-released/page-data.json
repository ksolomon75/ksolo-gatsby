I had to go this route in order to add the color features, but it opens up the code for adding other features.</p>\n<p>One more note to mention. I have removed the &#8220;array&#8221; format option from the config.  I don&#8217;t think it would be of very much use in the widget, but if someone can explain how and why it should/can be used, I&#8217;d be much obliged.  I left the code for it in the widget file, so if you need it, you can edit the file to uncomment it (it&#8217;s on line 217 in tag-cloud.php).</p>\n<p>As always, you can find the latest release of the plugin <a href=\"http://keithsolomon.net/ctc/\">here</a>.</p>\n","title":"WP 2.3 Configurable Tag Cloud Widget – Version 2 Released!","date":"October 03, 2007","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/ctc-widget-version-25/","title":"CTC Widget – Version 2.5"},"next":{"uri":"/wordpress-23-tag-cloud-widget/","title":"WordPress 2.3 Tag Cloud Widget"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo1NQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo2Mg==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo0OQ=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
