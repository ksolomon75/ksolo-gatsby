Packt Publishing has you covered with their new release, &#8220;WordPress Plugin Development Cookbook&#8221; by Yannick Lefebvre.  Through it&#8217;s 11 chapters, Yannick takes you from setting up your development environment through publishing your plugin in the official WordPress respository.</p>\n<p>Using language anyone could understand, Yannick covers topics from the simple (creating the WordPress plugin header, so you plugin shows up in the admin interface), to the complex (setting up a web server on your machine to test your plugin).  My only peeve would be the insistence upon using the NetBeans IDE.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it, but it&#8217;s a personal preference thing.  I love TextMate, and use it every day, but if I were writing a book, I&#8217;d make a mention of it, but not base large portions of text to it.</p>\n<p>Overall, &#8220;WordPress Plugin Development Cookbook&#8221; is a worthy addition to your library if youre looking to get into writing WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>Book Title:</strong> &#8220;WordPress Plugin Development Cookbook&#8221;<br />\n<strong>Author:</strong> Yannick Lefebvre<br />\n<strong>Publisher:</strong> Packt Publishing<br />\n<strong>Cost:</strong> $22.94 (ebook only)/$40.49 (Print copy, ebook copy, and PacktLib access)</p>\n<p>You can get a copy (either in print or any of several ebook formats, including epub and pdf) at <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/wordpress-plugin-development-cookbook/book\">Packt Publishing</a>.</p>\n<p><small><em>Disclaimer: Packt Publishing provided me with a promo copy of the book for this review.</em></small></p>\n","title":"Mini Book Review: “WordPress Plugin Development Cookbook”","date":"October 26, 2012","featuredImage":null},"previous":{"uri":"/the-future-of-the-ctc-plugin/","title":"The future of the CTC plugin"},"next":{"uri":"/cms-like-admin-menu-plugin-version-2-1-released/","title":"CMS-like Admin Menu Plugin – Version 2.1 Released."}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MDU=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0NjA=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNzc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1682016598","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
